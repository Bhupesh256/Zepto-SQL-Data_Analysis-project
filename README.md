🛒 Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst  Project
This is a complete, real-world data analyst  project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

This project is perfect for:

📊 Data Analyst aspirants who want to build a strong Portfolio Project for interviews and LinkedIn
📚 Anyone learning SQL hands-on
💼 Preparing for interviews in retail, e-commerce, or product analytics

📌 Project Overview
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

◉sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

◉name: Product name as it appears on the app

◉category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

◉mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

◉discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

◉discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

◉availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

◉weightInGms: Product weight in grams

◉outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

◉quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

🔧 Project Workflow

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation

We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
2. Data Import

◉ Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

◉ If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:

   \copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.

3. 🔍 Data Exploration
   
◉Counted the total number of records in the dataset

◉Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

◉Checked for null values across all columns

◉Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

◉Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

◉Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning

● Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero  

● Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

5. 📊 Business Insights
   
● Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

● Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

● Estimated potential revenue for each product category

● Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

● Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

● Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

● Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

● Measured total inventory weight per product category
